Welcome to TechNerd
===================================

Hello, tech enthusiasts!! I'm Sai Aravind, a passionate robotic engineer specializing in swarm robotic systems. I just can't get enough of tinkering with robots and trying out new things. Whether it's diving into the latest tech or figuring out how things work, I love to learn and share what I know.

I've put together this blog with beginners in mind. It's got some basic tutorials to help you kick off your own robotic projects. So, if you're just starting out or need a bit of help with your projects, I've got your back!

Interested in discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or simply geeking out over robotics? Don't hesitate to reach out!
